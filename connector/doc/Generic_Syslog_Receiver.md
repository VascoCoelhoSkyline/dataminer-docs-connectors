# Generic Syslog Receiver

## About

The Generic Syslog Receiver is a DataMiner connector dedicated to capturing, consolidating, and analyzing information received via Syslog messages. It functions as a central listening post, gathering critical operational and security data sent from one or more network devices across the infrastructure. By processing these raw messages, the connector extracts severity, enables filtering, triggers alarms, and writes Syslog messages to files.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Syslog Centralization**: Listens via a smart-serial connection to capture from multiple network devices.

- **Syslog Message Display**: Automatically processes incoming Syslog messages and displays their data in the Message Table with associated severity levels.

- **Filtering and Search**: Provides tools to filter the overview of incoming messages based on message severity or specific data content within the message text.

- **Alarm Triggering**: Allows users to define specific criteria (based on message content) in the Alarm Configuration table to trigger DataMiner alarms immediately when critical events occur.

- **Historical Logging**: Includes the capability to write all incoming Syslog messages directly to local log files.

## Use Cases

### Centralized Monitoring

**Challenge**: Manually checking Syslog messages across different device types for events is time-consuming and often leads to delayed response times.

**Solution**: The Generic Syslog Receiver acts as a single, dedicated endpoint, instantly capturing and centralizing all Syslog messages in the Message Table where they can be categorized by severity.

**Benefit**: Provides a unified, real-time overview of event logs across the entire network, drastically reducing the time required to detect and respond to anomalies.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- Network Configuration is needed to ensure the sending device is configured to forward Syslog messages to the DataMiner Element.

- IP Address/Host must be set to the specific keyword any so that the connector acts as the receiving server.

- IP Port (default 514) must be configured to match the port used by the sending network devices.
